************* Dragonslair ****************
******************************************

Dragonslair is a two column theme for Moodle 2
with eight extra block areas (four top and
four bottom).

This theme still need revision to work in
Moodle 2.3

NB: While the theme is for Moodle 2.2, the
version.php file contains the information
for lowering this requirement. Theme has not
been tested in 2.0 or 2.1, so doing so is
currently at your own risk. My aim is to
have this theme fully compatible with all
versions of Moodle 2.

*************** Installing ***************
If you have downloaded this from github,
unzip the file, rename the
"kihitara-moodle-theme_dragonslair-NUMBERS"
folder to "dragonslair", then copy that folder
to your Moodle theme directory.
